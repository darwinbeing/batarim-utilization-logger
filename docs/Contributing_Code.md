# Contributing Code #

If you want to contribute code to this project, please send me a pull request
rather than a patch. If you are not on Github, please email me
(jeff@beyondtechnicallycorrect.com) the URL you want me to pull from.

Please be aware of the code conventions explained in the Code_Conventions.md
file before making changes or adding to the source code.

The file Architecture_Overview.md offers a birds-eye view of the design of this
project and the dependency_graph.dot file can be used with Graphviz's dot
application to generate an image file with a dependency graph. An example
command on Linux would be, `dot -Tpng -O dependency_graph.dot` which would
generate a png file of the dependency graph.

If you have any questions or want some clarification about the project, feel
free to send me an email at jeff@beyondtechnicallycorrect.com.

## If You Don't Want to Use Git ##

If you would prefer to not use Git, you can use Mercurial with the `hg-git` and `bookmarks` extensions enabled to interact with Git repositories. I would also
recommend using the `eol` extension while working on this project if you are
using a Windows environment.
